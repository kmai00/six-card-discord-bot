# six-card-discord-bot

This bot is essentially a text version of the game of Six Card aka [Cắt tê](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%E1%BA%AFt_t%C3%AA "Cắt tê")

Right now how the project is setup is that it is one game per instance. Meaning that one game needs one instance of the bot. The reason why I did that is because this was a fun project for me that meant for my friends and I to play via Discord so I did no bother handling multiple sessions and etc.

This project is still a **work in process**. I will update the feature list and what commands do what once it's up and running
